## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)

Used a orange background with black text. I also created a scoreboard using HTML and CSS. Then I used a the Math.random() method to get a random number between 0-1. Then I broke up the range into 3 parts. Then I used an If-statement to assign what the computer will choose based on the random number and which range it falls into. Then I used the JavaScript to update the scoreboard and to output a response of what the computer chose and if you won or not.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how effective JQuery could be. First with the methods that are tied with JQuery, and how simple the syntax is compared to vanilla JavaScript.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
